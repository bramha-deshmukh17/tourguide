Arthur's Seat Point is made up of 6 viewpoints - Arthur's Seat Point, Tiger Sprint Point, Hunter Point, Echo Point, Window Point and Malcolm Point. Arthur's Seat is famous for the floating of light object. This means that if you throw light things like a bottle cap into the valley, it floats back up due to air pressure. It is named as Arthur's Point after Arthur Malet whose wife and daughter drowned in the Savitri River. He used to sit at this point and stare at the river below. Reaching the viewpoint requires a 30-minute trek from the parking lot."
